                        <p>HI GUYSSS! I‚Äôm Sara and I am so excited to be running for caucus with my amazing team and co-president Elly! A lot of you may know me from Stuy Social, where I‚Äôm currently the director of marketing! I‚Äôm also on the Stuy PF debate team (I love yapping), and I just finished an internship with Senator Iwen Chu! In middle school, I was on the debate team, SLT, and founded the Kindness Association! I‚Äôm guessing you can see I love interacting and talking to people, which is one of the reasons I wanted to run for caucus. Outside of school, I like to explore different places of NYC and film videos! By being your Freshmen caucus presidents, Elly and I will place utmost priority on hearing and representing everyone in the student body. With our FRESH ideas, we plan to create an empowering and welcoming environment for each and every single one of you! </p>
