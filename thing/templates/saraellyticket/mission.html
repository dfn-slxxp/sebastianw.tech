                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Freshmen Podcast</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Freshman make up a quarter part of the student body, but our voices are much quieter than those of other grades. By having a podcast, freshmen will be able to voice their opinions on a platform where they will be heard. The Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket is in partnership with Stuy Talk Tuah, which many of you may or may not have heard of already. StuyTalkTuah has a large platform on instagram, which is perfect for getting out these freshmen opinions. We will make it very easy for freshmen to take charge in our community and create change!</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Via our partnership with StuyTalkTuah, we will allow freshmen to come on and participate in active discussion where they are allowed to voice their thoughts. Every two weeks, we will send out a google form for people to sign up to be on the podcast. We will film these podcasts using equipment we already own. The podcasts will be edited and put on the StuyTalkTuah Instagram. This will make it easy for us, as your co-presidents, to identify if an issue is very serious and needs immediate attention.</p>

                <div class="fresh-item">
                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Improved Distribution of Sanitary Products</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">In the survey that was posted on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sara_elly_ticket">Sara_Elly_Ticket</a> Instagram account, we noticed that some people were concerned about the distribution of sanitary products. Some floors had more than others. To solve this problem, the Mostafa-Wu-Feng ticket has talked to a few custodians to identify the root cause; funding. The custodian we spoke to, Dawn, explains how a couple years ago, sanitary products were free, and therefore there was a large amount of the supplies. However, they are not free now and the sanitary department does not get funding for these products. While they are available in the nurse's office, many girls are too scared and intimidated, or are sometimes unable to go and get a product from the third floor. And that's primarily why this uneven distribution is a huge issue.</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">We spoke with Mr. Moran and Dawn, who both highlighted the lack of funding in the custodial department as a challenge. To support this need, we plan to raise funds through bake sales, donations, and other events, especially around Women’s Day in March. Dawn also pointed out that bathrooms on floors one through six are the busiest, while upper floors see less traffic. To address this, we will prioritize distributing sanitary products on the lower floors and allocate fewer to floors seven through ten. This approach will ensure an equitable distribution of products where they’re most needed. The Mostafa-Wu Feng team is committed to maintaining a strong, collaborative relationship with the custodial staff to keep this program effective and sustainable.</p>

                <div class="fresh-item">
                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Portable Chargers</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">We’re seriously listening to you! A lot of freshmen don't have portable chargers, or their own die throughout the day. That is why the Mostafa-Wu-Feng ticket will try to get portable chargers in the library. Portable chargers are more convenient than a charging station as it allows for you to keep your device with you, and it is less work for our already very hardworking librarians and library monitors. They would be available for lighting chargers and USBC. The normal rules of checking out an item would apply (must check out, must return before leaving, etc.)</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Based on our conversations with our librarians (Sara is a library monitor), the main issue is funding. The library receives donations from the Alumni Association. To get portable chargers, we would have to reach an agreement with the Alumni Association by demonstrating a need for these portable charges. We plan to do this by using a google form, which we will then provide the results of to the student coordinator of the Alumni Association. After that happens, we will attempt to reach an agreement with the Alumni Association itself about how many chargers we can allocate.</p>

                <div class="fresh-item">
                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Bathroom Hooks</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Another issue mentioned in the survey results was Stuyvesant’s rusty bathroom hooks. These bathrooms are very old and therefore their practicality has also worn down. The Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket plans to install new hooks in the bathrooms! We acknowledge that doing this may be tough, but we will try to the best of our ability. Anything to make the lives of our freshmen easier!</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">After discussing with faculty members, including Mr. Moran, we learned that Stuyvesant actually does not own this building. What that means is we will have to contact the Battery Park Association and figure out their process, and how we can come about this change. We will be getting in contact with them shortly! We also found out that the Cayla Chew-Vanna Lei freshman caucus administration (from two or three years ago) was able to install hooks in the swim gym showers, so we also reached out to Cayla, now VP of the Student Union, and discussed with her how they were able to accomplish that. These two are very similar policies, and we are confident in successfully implementing our plan. The Mostafa-Wu Feng team plans to give it their all.</p>

                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Cold Emailing and LinkedIn Workshops</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Stuyvesant has one of the strongest and largest alumni networks in the country. We have thousands upon thousands of members in our network who are at the top of their fields, studying at top colleges, doing amazing work in different industries, and other impressive activities. What a lot of freshmen are unaware of is that contacting alumni and networking can actually be REALLY beneficial when it comes to finding opportunities in and out of Stuy! Us freshmen should know how to properly contact our alumni in a professional way, where we can establish the connection we want to make. These bi-weekly cold emailing and LinkedIn workshops provided by the Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket will provide all the information a freshmen will need to know to succeed in networking!</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Currently, we are in contact with the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association. We plan to partner with them, their interns, and other upperclassmen who are well-versed with LinkedIn and networking. They can teach you everything we need to know about contacting alumni! We will hold hour-long workshops two times a month, where we go over the basics of how to find alumni, how to contact them, what questions, etc. We hope you show up!</p>

                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Increased Internship access</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">A common issue that a lot of freshmen face is not finding opportunities due to age and/or experience. The Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket is establishing a network within Stuy Social, allowing for freshmen to receive priority for internships and other opportunities. We understand that the opportunities bulletin list exists, however what differentiates us is that we can provide unique and new internships curated specifically for the freshmen of Stuy. We will attempt to make it easier for freshmen to find, apply, and get internships that are perfect for their skill level! This allows freshmen to discover new career paths and take advantage of early immersion in the fields they seek to dig further into.</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">The Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket intends to work with Stuy Social to provide these opportunities to freshmen. Stuy Social is a chapter of City Youth Network, which is an organization aimed towards connecting the youth of New York City to opportunities and resources. We will help freshmen access the internships they specifically want through the connections of Stuy Social. We will also push Stuy Social to give priority of other internships to freshmen who may want them, and we will also push them to support you guys! Sara, who's the director of marketing at Stuy Social intends to dedicate a lot of time to each and every single one of you!</p>

                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Alumni Guest Speakers</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Stuyvesant is tough, but what's great about the school is that there are thousands of people before us who have gone through the exact same situations we are going through right now. The Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket plans to have Alumni come speak to freshmen every other month. Guest speakers may go over a wide variety of topics such as studying, extracurriculars, social life balance, college, etc. A lot of you guys may think that this is unnecessary, but times are changing. It is increasingly more difficult to find impressive opportunities and survive in school at the same time. We want freshmen to have an easier time adapting to the changing system of college admissions. By having alumni speak to freshmen, we are hoping you guys take away some valuable information that can benefit you throughout the year!</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">We will partner with the Alumni Association, as mentioned earlier, to connect with these alumni and let them speak to all of you! And moreover, we acknowledge that the alumni who will be talking to you guys will need to be checked out and verified. The Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket plans to contact Mr. Moran and learn more about this process.</p>

                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Commute Buddies</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Many freshmen at Stuy face long, often solitary commutes, which can feel both tiring and isolating. To make these journeys safer and more enjoyable, the Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket proposes a "Commute Buddies" program. This initiative will connect students with others in their area, helping them travel together, make friends, and enjoy a safer, more supportive commute experience every day.</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">We recognize that "Commute Buddies" is an idea that past tickets have suggested, but the Mostafa-Wu Feng ticket is committed to actually bringing it to life and implementing it effectively. We’re focused on creating a safe, well-organized program to help freshmen connect, travel together, and build a stronger, more supportive community.We plan to create a google sheet of people who filled out a google form providing their names, what train they take, their contact info, and their train stop. We will keep this information private to ourselves and cabinet members to prevent stalking. After collecting data, we will match people up based on what train station and what train they use. We will not interfere any further than that as we want people to make friendships and get to know each other at their own pace!</p>

                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Half Floor Beanbags</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Freshman have claimed the half floor as their own space, however, it doesn't feel much established compared to the upperclassmen “Bars.” By adding some cozy decor like beanbags, we can help create a bigger sense of community on the half floor. This can connect more freshmen to each other, allowing more friendships to blossom!</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">While speaking with faculty members, we narrowed down some things that we’d need to do to make this feasible. First of all, we need to create a plan with the custodians, as the beanbags can potentially be a fire hazard. However, if we space the beanbags and put them in the right places on the half floor, we can circumvent this issue. Furthermore, we need money for the beanbags. Due to the multitude of freshmen who eagerly want this to happen, we are sure that raising money will not be a problem. We plan to have fun fundraising events like game tournaments and bake sales! Lastly, we will create and send out Google Forms so freshmen who wish to utilize a beanbag during their free periods can reserve a spot.</p>

                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Freshmen Caucus Website</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Stuyvesant is undoubtedly very, very, VERY stressful. Because of this, a lot of our own students have created discord servers, guides, and more relating to some of the main problems at Stuy. However, with so many resources available all over the place, it can get frustrating when freshmen try to find the specific resource they are looking for. We plan to partner with our I.T department to create a Freshman Caucus Website where all links, study guides, Discord study servers, etc. are included in one place. We can also include a calendar for upcoming events and deadlines, so freshmen don't have to deal with being unaware or unorganized.</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Historically, many of Stuy’s most impactful platforms have been created by our own students. For instance, Epsilon was coded by a Class of ‘25 senior. We know our freshman class is full of talented individuals who want to contribute to our community. That’s why we’re committed to partnering with the I.T. department and any interested freshmen to create a Freshman Caucus website—an accessible, student-driven hub for information, updates, and events. This will be a platform created for freshmen, by freshmen, showcasing our skills and building a lasting resource for our class.</p>

                    <p class="fresh-subtitle">Freshman Documentary Instagram</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">Have anything you’re proud of that you want to share? Want to post cute videos of your friends on an account you can look back at in the future? The Freshmen Documentary Instagram is the perfect way to keep relics of your freshman year memories, and see your peers' memories too! This account will help freshmen connect beyond the classroom, turning familiar faces into friendships and building a lasting sense of community.</p>
                    <p class="fhow">How will we do this?</p>
                    <p class="fresh-text">There are going to be guidelines with this as it is associated with Stuyvesant afterall. The account will be managed by the Freshman Caucus cabinet, and submission will be sent through DMs. Each post will be double checked by the Student Union before being posted. Post must not promote anything related to violence, drug/substance use, profanity, or sexual behavior. There will be more rules available when the account launches!!! We know some may wonder why this account is worth it when personal accounts are already a place to post. Here’s the difference: the Freshman Documentary Instagram is a collective space, focused on capturing and preserving memories unique to our freshman year as a grade, where everyone can see each other's experiences in one place. This isn’t just about individual posts; it’s about creating a shared narrative for our class. And yes, we’re committed to keeping the account active for the full year! While it’s mainly for freshman year, we’ll leave it as an archive, giving us something special to look back on as we progress through high school. This isn’t just an Instagram—it’s a way to represent our class, connect, and celebrate each other.</p>
